assessment for instance of 'java.util.ImmutableCollections.Map1':
    ■ instance of 'java.util.ImmutableCollections.Map1' is mutable because index 0 contains mutable instance of 'io.github.mikenakis.bathyscaphe.internal.helpers.ConcreteMapEntry'. (MutableComponentMutableObjectAssessment)
    ├─■ type 'java.util.ImmutableCollections.Map1' is provisory because it is preassessed by default as a composite of type 'java.lang.Object'. (CompositeProvisoryTypeAssessment)
    │ └─■ type 'java.lang.Object' is provisory because it is an extensible class. (ExtensibleProvisoryTypeAssessment)
    └─■ instance of 'io.github.mikenakis.bathyscaphe.internal.helpers.ConcreteMapEntry' is mutable because field 'value' contains mutable instance of 'java.util.ArrayList'. (MutableFieldValueMutableObjectAssessment)
      ├─■ type 'io.github.mikenakis.bathyscaphe.internal.helpers.ConcreteMapEntry' is provisory due to multiple reasons. (MultiReasonProvisoryTypeAssessment)
      │ ├─■ type 'io.github.mikenakis.bathyscaphe.internal.helpers.ConcreteMapEntry' is provisory because field 'key' is provisory. (ProvisoryFieldProvisoryTypeAssessment)

      └─■ instance of 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable because it is of a mutable class. (MutableClassMutableObjectAssessment)
        └─■ class 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable due to multiple reasons. (MultiReasonMutableTypeAssessment)
          ├─■ class 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable because it extends mutable class 'java.util.AbstractList'. (MutableSuperclassMutableTypeAssessment)
          │ └─■ class 'java.util.AbstractList' is mutable because field 'modCount' is mutable. (MutableFieldMutableTypeAssessment)
          │   └─■ field 'modCount' is mutable because it is not final, and it has not been annotated with @Invariable. (VariableMutableFieldAssessment)
          ├─■ class 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable because field 'elementData' is mutable. (MutableFieldMutableTypeAssessment)
