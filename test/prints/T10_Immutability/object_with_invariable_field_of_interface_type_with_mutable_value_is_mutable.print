assessment for instance of 'io.github.mikenakis.bathyscaphe.test.T10_Immutability$7$ClassWithInvariableFieldOfInterfaceTypeWithMutableValue':
    ■ instance of 'io.github.mikenakis.bathyscaphe.test.T10_Immutability$7$ClassWithInvariableFieldOfInterfaceTypeWithMutableValue' is mutable because field 'mutableField' contains mutable instance of 'java.util.ArrayList'. (MutableFieldValueMutableObjectAssessment)
    ├─■ type 'io.github.mikenakis.bathyscaphe.test.T10_Immutability$7$ClassWithInvariableFieldOfInterfaceTypeWithMutableValue' is provisory because field 'mutableField' is provisory. (ProvisoryFieldProvisoryTypeAssessment)
    │ └─■ field 'mutableField' is provisory because it is of provisory type 'java.util.List'. (ProvisoryFieldTypeProvisoryFieldAssessment)
    │   └─■ type 'java.util.List' is provisory because it is an interface. (InterfaceProvisoryTypeAssessment)
    └─■ instance of 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable because it is of a mutable class. (MutableClassMutableObjectAssessment)
      └─■ class 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable due to multiple reasons. (MultiReasonMutableTypeAssessment)
        ├─■ class 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable because it extends mutable class 'java.util.AbstractList'. (MutableSuperclassMutableTypeAssessment)
        │ └─■ class 'java.util.AbstractList' is mutable because field 'modCount' is mutable. (MutableFieldMutableTypeAssessment)
        │   └─■ field 'modCount' is mutable because it is not final, and it has not been annotated with @Invariable. (VariableMutableFieldAssessment)
        ├─■ class 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable because field 'elementData' is mutable. (MutableFieldMutableTypeAssessment)
        │ └─■ field 'elementData' is mutable because it is not final, and it has not been annotated with @Invariable. (VariableMutableFieldAssessment)
        └─■ class 'java.util.ArrayList' is mutable because field 'size' is mutable. (MutableFieldMutableTypeAssessment)
          └─■ field 'size' is mutable because it is not final, and it has not been annotated with @Invariable. (VariableMutableFieldAssessment)
