	// PEARL: Windows has a stupid notion of a "current directory", which is a mutable global variable of process-wide scope.
	//        This means that any thread can modify it, and all other threads will be affected by the modification.
	//        (And in a DotNet process, any AppDomain can modify it, and all other AppDomains will be affected! So much for AppDomain isolation!)
	//        Java does not exactly have such a notion, but the "user.dir" system property (which you can get and set) is effectively the same.
	// NOTE:  When maven is running tests, the "user.dir" system property contains the root directory of the current module being tested.
	//        When testana is running tests, it sets the "user.dir" property accordingly.
	//        Thus, when running tests either via maven or via testana, we can obtain the path to the root directory of the current module.
