# Code of Conduct

- Keep the discussion strictly technical, and nobody gets hurt.

- Criticize a person's (technical) choices, not the person. 
  - For example:

|     | Wrong                                                | Correct                                          |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

|     | _Scripting language programmers are retarded_.       | _Scripting languages are retarded_.              |
