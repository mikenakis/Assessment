  - The full text of this license can be found here: [LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.txt](LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.txt)
  - The GNUAGPL is a _viral_, _strong copyleft_ open-source license with an additional provision for _server-side software_. This means that any software making use of Bathyscaphe must in turn be open-sourced under the same license, **_even if_** that software would not normally be distributed, as the case is, for example, with server-side software. See [Wikipedia: GNU Affero General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License).

  - The full text of this license can be found here: [LICENSE-BATCL-1.0.txt](LICENSE-BATCL-1.0.txt)
  - The BATCL is a commercial license available for developers who want to use Bathyscaphe without being bound by the GNUAGPL, i.e. without having to publish their source code. The BATCL can be purchased from the author for a small fee. Payment is done simply and quickly, via PayPal.
