- ### <a name="license-bathyscaphe-claims">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a>Module `bathyscaphe-claims`: MIT license

    - The `bathyscaphe-claims` module is available under the **_MIT License_**, which is a very permissive open source license, allowing Bathyscaphe annotations to be freely used in any kind of code with minimal licensing concerns. See [Wikipedia: MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

- ### <a name="license-bathyscaphe">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a>Modules `bathyscaphe` and `bathyscaphe-test`: Dual license

  The `bathyscaphe` and `bathyscaphe-test` modules of Bathyscaphe are available under a dual-license scheme. You can choose either the GNUAGPL v.3 license, or the BATCL v.1 license. If you take no action regarding licensing, the license that applies by default is the GNUAGPL.

    - #### <a name="license-bathyscaphe-agpl">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a>GNU Affero General Public License (GNUAGPL) v.3

      The GNUAGPL is a _viral_, _strong copyleft_ open-source license with an additional provision for _server-side software_. This means that any software making use of these modules must in turn be open-sourced under the same license, **_even if_** that software would not normally be distributed, as the case is, for example, with server-side software. See [Wikipedia: GNU Affero General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License).

    - #### <a name="license-bathyscaphe-commercial">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a>Bathyscaphe Alternative Terms Commercial license (BATCL) v.1

      The BATCL is a commercial license available for developers who want to use the `bathyscaphe` module and/or the `bathyscaphe-test` module without being bound by the GNUAGPL, because they do not want to have to publish their source code. The BATCL can be purchased from the author for a small fee. Payment is done simply and quickly, via PayPal.
